Hired soldiers who will guard, patrol, and otherwise serve in wilderness settings, but only as part of a larger force, not an adventuring party.

Note that as mercenaries are hired by a character to perform specific services, they are not treated as retainers and thus do not count toward a character’s maximum number of retainers. 

# Wages

**Outside of wartime**: As listed below.

**During wartime**: All wages are doubled.

# Upkeep

The monthly rate of pay includes food and basic gear. Most mercenaries already have weapons and armour when hired, though their employer may give them additional gear. Note that armourers are required to repair mercenaries’ armour and weapons (see Specialists).
