# Rolling Randomly

Monster listings note which treasure type is present in the creature’s lair and which it may carry on its person. Each treasure type (see below) lists one or more types of coins or items that may be found in the hoard. For each item in the list:

1. If a percentage value is given, first roll d100 to see whether this item is present in the hoard.
2. If a range of values is given (e.g. 1d6 × 1,000cp, 6d6 gems), roll the specified dice to determine the quantity of this item that is present in the hoard.
3. For gems, jewellery, and magic items, the procedures for determining the value and properties of the items in the hoard are found in later sections.

## Manual Adjustments
If the value of the randomly generated treasure is significantly above or below the average value of the treasure type, the referee may adjust the results manually.

# Referee Choice
The referee may wish to choose treasures appropriate to the monsters and the PC party. As treasure is the main source of XP (see Awarding XP), the referee should carefully consider treasure placement. The following procedure is recommended:

1. Consider the size of the adventuring party, the levels of the characters, and the XP they need to go up in level.
2. Decide how many experience points the treasure hoard should provide if the party successfully acquires it.
3. Place treasures whose total value matches the determined XP total.

## Balance of Reward Versus Danger
When using this approach, the referee should ensure that the treasure is guarded by sufficiently powerful monsters. Adventurers should have to earn this reward!

# Items of Value
**Common treasures**: The treasure tables (see below) describe methods for generating hoards of coins, gems, jewellery, and magic items.

**Unusual treasures**: Adventures may also include valuable items of other kinds, whose worth may not always be obvious:

* **Artwork**: Paintings, statuary.
* **Books**: Rare tomes or scrolls.
* **Foodstuffs**: Spices, valuable wines.
* **Furnishings**: Rugs, tapestries.
* **Utensils**: Silver cutlery, unusual kitchen or laboratory implements.
* **Valuables**: Furs, ivory, ores, silks.

## Value and Weight
For each unusual item placed, the referee should note its value (in gold pieces) and (if using the optional rules for Encumbrance) its weight.
