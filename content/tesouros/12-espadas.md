**B**: Basic characters (levels 1–3)
**X**: Expert characters (level 4+)

# Cursed Swords

* **Penalty**: Cursed swords specify a penalty that is applied to both attack rolls and damage rolls made with the weapon.
* **Discarding**: Once the sword has been used in combat, the character comes under the curse and is not able to discard the item. In fact, they will favour the sword and use it whenever possible. The curse can only be removed with magic.

# Enchanted Swords
* **Bonus**: Enchanted swords specify a bonus that is applied to both attack rolls and damage rolls made with the weapon.
* **Bonus vs creature type**: Some swords have a special bonus when used against a certain type of creature.

# Sentient Swords
Some magic swords have an innate intelligence and personality, along with other special powers. See Sentient Swords, for rules for determining the special powers of a sentient sword.
* **Probability**: If the referee wishes to randomly determine whether a magic sword is intelligent, the probability is 30%.

# Swords With a Special Purpose
Some magic swords are imbued with a special purpose. Such swords are extremely powerful and are always sentient. See Sentient Swords, for rules for determining the powers of a sword with a special purpose.
* **Probability**: There is a 1-in-20 chance of a magic sword having a special purpose. The referee may choose to only place such swords by design, rather than rolling this chance randomly.

# Sword +1, Energy Drain
Drains the life energy of its victims.
* **On a successful hit**: The wielder may command the sword to drain the victim’s life energy.
* **Energy drain**: In addition to suffering normal damage, the target permanently loses one experience level (or Hit Die). This incurs a loss of one Hit Die of hit points, as well as all other benefits due to the drained level (e.g. spells, saving throws, etc.). A character’s XP is reduced to the lowest amount for the new level. A person drained of all levels dies.
* **Charges**: The sword may drain a total of 1d4+4 levels. Once this many levels have been drained, it becomes a normal magical sword +1.

# Sword +1, Flaming
Bursts into flames, on command. When flaming:
* **Casts light**: In 30’ radius.
* **Can set things alight**: Treated as a torch, for purposes of setting things on fire (e.g. a web spell).
* **Inflicts fire damage**: Which may have special effects on certain creatures.
* **Grants an attack bonus**: Against certain types of creature:
  * +2 vs trolls (or other creatures that cannot regenerate fire damage).
  * +2 vs pegasi, hippogriffs, and rocs (or other bird-like creatures).
  * +3 vs treants (or other plant-based creatures).
  * +3 vs undead.
* **Duration**: The sword blazes until commanded to cease.

# Sword +1, Light
On command, produces light in a 30’ radius.

# Sword +2, Charm Person
Grants the wielder the ability to charm other people.
* **Effect**: This works in the same way as the magic-user spell Charm Person.
* **Usage frequency**: The power may be used up to three times a week.

# Sword +1, Locate Objects
Grants the wielder the ability to detect the presence of objects within 120’.
* **Effect**: This works in the same way as the magic-user spell Locate Object.
* **Usage frequency**: The power may be used once per day.
