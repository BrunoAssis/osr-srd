# Gems
The value of each gem in a treasure hoard is determined by the following table:

+----------+---------------+
| Gem Values               |
+==========+===============+
| **d20**  | **Gem Value** |
+----------+---------------+
| 1–4      | 10gp          |
+----------+---------------+
| 5–9      | 50gp          |
+----------+---------------+
| 10–15    | 100gp         |
+----------+---------------+
| 16–19    | 500gp         |
+----------+---------------+
| 20       | 1,000gp       |
+----------+---------------+

# Jewellery
Each piece of jewellery indicated by a treasure type is worth 3d6 × 100gp (or more, if the referee wishes, for characters above 3rd level).

## Damaged Jewellery
Rough treatment of jewellery (e.g. crushing, intense heat or fire, lightning) can damage it, reducing its value by 50%.

# Combining Values
When a treasure type indicates the presence of multiple gems or pieces of jewellery, the referee may combine the values, as desired. For example, a roll of five 50gp value gems may be placed as a single 250gp gem, a 100gp gem and three 50gp gems, or any other combination.
