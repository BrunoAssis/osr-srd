# Ring of Controlling Animals
Grants the power to control the actions of animals.
* **Affects**: 1d6 normal animals or 1 giant animal (not magical or intelligent animals).
* **Resisting**: No saving throw is allowed.
* **Visual range**: The character can only control animals that they can see.
* **Concentration**: Control is broken if the user of the ring moves or attacks.
* **When concentration ends**: The referee should make a reaction roll with a –1 penalty (see Encounters, p114) to determine the animals’ behaviour.
* **Usage frequency**: May be used up to once per turn.

# Ring of Controlling Humans
Grants the power to charm humans.
* **Usage**: A charm may be placed upon a human within 60’. One target may be charmed per round.
* **Resisting**: The subject may save versus spells (with a –2 penalty) to resist.
* **Maximum subjects**: Up to 6 Hit Dice of humans may be charmed in this way. Normal humans count as ½ HD.
* **Charmed individuals**: Regard the character as a trusted friend, and will come to their defence. They will obey the character’s commands, as long as these are not obviously harmful and do not contradict the subject’s alignment.
* **Duration**: The charm lasts until dispelled, until the ring is removed, or until the wearer cancels it.

# Ring of Controlling Plants
Grants the power to control plants.
* **Affects**: All plants (including plant monsters) in a 10’ square area.
* **Range**: The area may be up to 60’ distant.
* **Commands**: Affected plants may be commanded to move around as the character wishes.
* **Concentration**: The effect lasts as long as the wearer of the ring concentrates.

# Ring of Delusion
The wearer believes is under the effects of another type of magic ring.
* **Type**: The other type of ring should be determined by the referee (e.g. a ring of protection or a ring of spell turning).
* **Describing**: The referee should try to trick the player into believing that the character is under the effects of the other ring, only revealing the truth at some vital juncture.

# Ring of Djinni Summoning
This ring grants the power to summon a djinni (see p151).
* **Duration of service**: The djinni will serve the character who summoned it for up to 24 hours.
* **Commands**: The djinni only obeys the one who summoned it—another character who takes the ring has no power over the djinni.
* **Usage frequency**: The ring may be used up to once per day.

# Ring of Fire Resistance
Grants the wearer protection against fire.
* **Normal fire**: Unharmed by non-magical fire.
* **Save bonus**: Gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws versus fire-based magical or breath attacks.
* **Fire-based damage**: Is reduced by 1 point per damage die rolled. (Each die inflicts a minimum of 1 hit point damage.)

# Ring of Invisibility
The wearer of this ring becomes invisible.
* **Attacking**: If the character attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility is broken.
* **Usage frequency**: May be used up to once per turn.

# Ring of Protection
Grants a measure of protection from harm:
* **Armour Class**: A +1 AC bonus.
* **Saving throws**: A +1 bonus to all saves.

# Ring of Protection, 5’ Radius
Allies within 5’ of the wearer also benefit from the ring’s protective power. For example, two characters fighting beside the wearer of the ring would gain the protective benefit.

# Ring of Regeneration
The wearer heals at an accelerated rate.
* **Rate**: The wearer regains 1 hit point per round.
* **Severed limbs**: Will also regrow. The rate depends on the size of the limb (e.g. finger may regrow in one day, while a whole limb may take a week).
* **Fire or acid damage**: Cannot be regenerated.
* **Death**: The ring does not function if the wearer is reduced to 0 or less hit points.

# Ring of Spell Storing
Stores a number of magical spells that the wearer can release on command.
* **Capacity**: The ring contains 1d6 spells. (The spells can be triggered and recharged, but cannot be changed.)
* **Type of magic**: There is a 20% chance of divine spells, otherwise they are arcane spells.
* **Knowledge**: The wearer of the ring knows which spells it contains.
* **Triggering**: The wearer of the ring can trigger the spells at will (up to one spell per round).
* **Caster level**: For spells whose effects vary by the level of the caster, the wearer of the ring is treated as a caster of the lowest level required to cast the spell.
* **Recharging**: Once a spell is triggered, it may not be reused until it is recharged—the expired spell must be cast directly onto the ring.

# Ring of Spell Turning
Spells cast on the wearer of this ring are reflected back onto the caster.
* **Charges**: After 2d6 spells are reflected, the ring loses its power.

# Ring of Telekinesis
Grants the power to move objects or creatures within 120’ by concentrating.
* **Weight**: Up to 2,000 coins of weight may be targeted.
* **Movement**: The target may be moved up to 20’ per round, in whatever direction the wearer of the ring wishes (including vertically).
* **Resisting**: A targeted creature may save versus spells to resist.
* **Concentration**: If concentration is broken, the target falls.

# Ring of Water Walking
Grants the power to walk on the surface of water, without sinking.

# Ring of Weakness
A cursed ring that weakens the wearer.
* **Effect**: Within 6 rounds of putting the ring on, the wearer’s STR is reduced to 3.
* **Removing**: The ring cannot be removed, once worn.
* **Dispelling**: The curse can be removed by magic (e.g. remove curse), or (at the referee’s option) by performing a special quest.

# Ring of Wishes
Grants the wearer’s wishes (see p233).
* **Charges**: The number of wishes granted is noted in the Rings table. Once all wishes have been used, the ring’s magic is spent.

# Ring of X-Ray Vision
Grants the power to see through solid objects.
* **Through dense materials**: Sight up to 60’ through less dense materials (cloth, water, wood) is possible.
* **Through stone**: Sight up to 30’ through stone is possible.
* **Obstructions**: Sight through gold or lead is blocked.
* **Searching**: When used for the purpose of searching (see Dungeon Adventuring, p108), the wearer is guaranteed to notice secret doors or traps in the 10’ square area being examined.
* **Concentration**: Using the ring requires concentration (the wearer cannot move).
* **Usage frequency**: May be used at most once per turn.
