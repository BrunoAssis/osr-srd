# Average Values
The average value of each treasure type is listed alongside the letter code. These values sum the average results of gems, jewellery, and all types of coins. Magic items that the treasure type may indicate are not counted toward the average value, as magic items do not have fixed sale values.

# Alternative Treasures
For genres or settings where precious metal coinage is not in common use, the referee may replace gold pieces etc. with currency of equivalent value. The same goes for gems and jewellery, which may be replaced with other kinds of valuable substances or decorative objects.

# Hoards: A–O
These treasure types indicate the sum wealth of a large monster or a community of smaller monsters. Such hoards are usually hidden in the monsters’ lair.

**Small lairs**: Monster listings note the number of individuals found in a lair. If the number rolled is below average and the lair encounter size is at least 1d4, the amount of treasure in the hoard may be reduced accordingly.
