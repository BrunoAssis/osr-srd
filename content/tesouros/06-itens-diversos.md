* **Effects**: Creatures that fail the saving throw or morale check flee from the sound of the drums at full running speed for 30 rounds.

# Efreeti Bottle

* **Attacking**: The cloak’s power of invisibility is nullified for one turn, if the wearer attacks.

# Flying Carpet

* 1 passenger: 300’ (100’).
* 2 passengers: 240’ (80’).
* 3 passengers: 180’ (60’).

# Gauntlets of Ogre Power
A character who wears these gauntlets has a Strength score of 18. This grants all the usual bonuses, including:
* **Melee attacks**: +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, in melee.
* **Unarmed attacks**: Deal 1d2+3 damage.

**Encumbrance**: If using the optional rules for detailed encumbrance (see Time, Weight, Movement, p102):
* **Extra weight**: The character’s ability to carry weight is increased by 1,000 coins. (i.e. the character can carry 1,400 coins without becoming encumbered.)

# Girdle of Giant Strength
A character who wears this girdle gains the strength of a hill giant.
* **Combat ability**: The wearer’s ability in combat is augmented: the character attacks as an 8 Hit Dice monster. (If the character already has better attack probabilities, the girdle does not alter these.)
* **Damage**: The wearer inflicts 2d8 damage in combat, or twice normal damage, if using the optional variable weapon damage rules (see Combat, p120).

# Helm of Alignment Changing
A beautifully crafted but cursed helmet.
* **Putting** on the helmet: Instantly causes the wearer’s alignment to change. The new alignment is determined at random.
* **Removing**: The curse is such that the wearer cannot remove the helmet, once in place, and will resist attempts to remove it.
* **Dispelling**: The curse can be removed by magic (e.g. remove curse), or (at the referee’s option) by performing a special quest.

# Helm of Reading Languages and Magic
A fragile helmet that grants the wearer the ability to read writing of all kinds.
* **Normal text**: Text in any language can be understood.
* **Magical text**: Even magical writing is comprehensible. (This does not grant the ability to cast spells, however.)
* **Fragility**: Each time the wearer is hit, there is a 1-in-10 chance of the helm being destroyed. If the wearer is killed, the helm is destroyed.

# Helm of Telepathy
A beautifully crafted helmet that grants the magical ability of telepathy: reading and sending thoughts.
* **Range**: The range of the power is 90’.
* **Concentration**: To read a creature’s thoughts, the wearer must remain still and concentrate on that creature.
* **Comprehension**: The creature’s thoughts are made comprehensible to the wearer of the helm.
* **Bidirectional communication**: The wearer may initiate bidirectional, telepathic communication, though the creature is not compelled to respond.

# Helm of Teleportation
A magical helm that gives an arcane spell caster the ability to cast the teleport spell (see p93).
* **Subject**: The wearer may teleport themselves, another creature, or an object.
* **Resisting**: If used on another creature or object, a save versus spells is allowed to resist being teleported.
* **When first found**: The helm’s power is usable only once.
* **Recharging**: To be used again, a teleport spell must be cast upon the helm.
* **Once recharged**: The wearer may use the helm an unlimited number of times (at most once per round). If the helm is used on an unwilling subject, it once again loses its power and must be recharged, as above, to be used again.

# Horn of Blasting
A horn that can be blown to release a blast of destructive noise.
* **Creatures**: Within a 100’ long cone (20’ wide at the end) suffer 2d6 damage.
* **Deafness**: Affected creatures are also deafened for one turn (save versus spells to avoid).
* **Buildings**: At the referee’s discretion, the horn may also be able to damage objects and buildings (e.g. a single blast might be enough to destroy a simple cottage; a 10’ section of castle wall might require three blasts).
* **Frequency**: The horn may be used once per turn.

# Medallion of ESP 30’
A medallion on a chain, enchanted with the power of reading thoughts.
* **Focus**: By concentrating for 1 round, the wearer may target a creature within 30’.
* **Resisting**: At the referee’s option, the target may save versus spells to resist.
* **Concentration**: While reading thoughts, the wearer may move, but cannot cast spells or attack.
* **Misfires**: The medallion is not entirely reliable. Per usage, there is a 1-in-6 chance of it misfiring, instead sending the wearer’s thoughts to all within 30’.

# Medallion of ESP 90’
A medallion on a chain, enchanted with the power of reading thoughts. This works in the same way as the magic-user spell ESP (see p81).

# Mirror of Life Trapping
A mirror with the ability to magically trap living creatures behind its pane.
* **Gazing into the mirror**: Any creature of human size or smaller who gazes into the mirror is sucked inside (save versus spells to resist), with all its belongings.
* **Capacity**: Up to 20 creatures can be trapped in the mirror. When this number is reached, it becomes safe to look into the mirror.
* **Inside the mirror**: A creature will live indefinitely, without the need for air or sustenance, and unaffected by ageing.
* **Communication**: Trapped creatures may converse with those outside, but are utterly powerless.
* **Breaking the mirror**: Releases those trapped.

# Rope of Climbing
A coil of thin, strong rope, 50’ in length.
* **Commanding**: The owner may command it to climb in any direction.
* **Attaching**: The rope can also be commanded to attach to a surface.
* **Load**: Up to 10,000 coins of weight can be suspended from the rope.

# Scarab of Protection
Protects the bearer from baleful magic.
* **Curses**: Of all kinds are nullified.
* **Finger of death**: (see p75) is nullified.
* **Charges**: The scarab’s enchantment works 2d6 times before it is spent.
