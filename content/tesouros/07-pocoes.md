**B**: Basic characters (levels 1–3) 

**X**: Expert characters (level 4+) 

**Usage**: All characters (unless noted).

**Identifying**: A potion may be identified by sipping a small amount. It is difficult to identify potions purely by smell or taste, as even potions with the same effect are not alike.

**Drinking**: Drinking a full dose of a potion takes one round, and brings on the magical effect for 1d6+6 turns. The referee should roll for and track this duration, and not tell the player how long the potion will last for. 

# Mixing Potions
Drinking a potion while already under the effects of another potion is dangerous:

* **Sickness**: The character is completely disabled for 3 turns, due to sickness.
* **Cancellation**: The effects of both potions are cancelled.

This rule does not apply to potions with instantaneous or permanent duration. 

# Potion of Clairaudience
Enables the character to hear through the ears of another creature.
* **Range**: The other creature must be within 60’.
* **Obstructions**: Lead blocks the effect.

# Potion of Clairvoyance
Enables the character to see through the eyes of another creature.
* **Range**: The other creature must be within 60’.
* **Obstructions**: Lead blocks the effect.

# Potion of Control
A potion of this type allows the one who drinks it to control the actions of creatures of a certain type.
* **Concentration**: Exercising control requires concentration.
* **Visual range**: The character can only control creatures that they can see.
* **Suicidal commands**: Controlled creatures will resist commands that are deadly to themselves.

# Control Animal
* **Affects**: Up to 3d6 Hit Dice of normal or giant (but not magical) animals.
* **When the potion’s effect ends**: Affected animals will move away.

# Control Dragon
* **Affects**: 1–3 dragons of a specific type. (The referee should determine which type of dragon the potion affects.)
* **Spell casting**: It is not possible to command a dragon to cast spells.
* **When the potion’s effect ends**: Affected dragons have a hostile reaction.

# Control Giant
* Affects: 1–4 giants of a specific type. (The referee should determine which type of giant the potion affects.)

# Control Human
* **Usage**: A charm may be placed upon a human within 60’. One target may be charmed per round.
* **Resisting**: The subject may save versus spells to resist the charm.
* **Maximum subjects**: Up to 6 Hit Dice of humans may be charmed in this way. Normal humans count as ½ HD.
* **Charmed individuals**: Regard the character as a trusted friend, and will come to their defence. They will obey the character’s commands, as long as these are not obviously harmful and do not contradict the subject’s alignment.

# Control Plant
* **Affects**: All plants (including plant monsters) in a 30’ square area up to 60’ distant.
* **Commands**: Affected plants may be commanded to move around as the character wishes, and may be used to entangle creatures in the area.

# Control Undead
* **Affects**: Up to 3d6 Hit Dice of undead.
* **When the potion’s effect ends**: Affected undead have a hostile reaction.

# Potion of Delusion
A character who drinks this potion believes is under the effects of another type of potion.
* **Type**: The other type of potion should be determined by the referee.
* **Describing**: The referee should try to trick the player into believing that the character is under the effects of the other potion, only revealing the truth at some vital juncture.

# Potion of Diminution
The character shrinks to 6” high.
* **Combat effectiveness**: While shrunk, the character is unable to harm creatures larger than 1’ tall.
* **Narrow spaces**: The character can slip through narrow spaces.
* **Remaining motionless**: The character only has a 10% chance of being spotted.

# Potion of ESP
Grants the power of reading thoughts. This works in the same way as the magic-user spell ESP (see p81). The standard potion duration applies.

# Potion of Fire Resistance
Grants protection against fire:
* **Normal heat**: Unharmed by non-magical heat or fire.
* **Save bonus**: Gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws versus fire-based magical or breath attacks.
* **Fire-based damage**: Is reduced by 1 point per damage die rolled. (Each die inflicts a minimum of 1 hit point damage.)

# Potion of Flying
Grants the ability to fly through the air.
* **Movement rate**: Up to 360’ (120’).
* **Free movement**: Is possible in any direction, including the ability to levitate and to hover in mid-air.

# Potion of Gaseous Form
The character’s body becomes a cloud of vapour. This has the following effects:

* **Attacks with weapons**: Inflict double damage.
* **Throw boulders**: The character may throw boulders for 3d6 damage, with a range of up to 200’.
* **Non-cumulative**: The effects of this potion are not cumulative with other magic items that augment strength (e.g. a girdle of giant strength).

# Potion of Growth
The character doubles in size.
* **Melee attacks**: The character’s increased strength means that their melee attacks deal double damage.

# Potion of Healing
Has one of two effects on the character who drinks it:
1. **Healing a living subject**: Restores 1d6+1 hit points of damage. This cannot grant more hit points than the subject’s normal maximum.
2. **Curing paralysis**: Paralysing effects are negated.

# Potion of Heroism
Normal humans and characters of a combat-focused, non-magic using class (e.g. dwarf, fighter, halfling) who drink a potion of heroism temporarily gain additional levels. The number of levels gained depends on the character’s normal experience level:
* **Normal human**: Gain the abilities of a 4th level fighter.
* **1st–3rd level**: Gain 3 levels.
* **4th–7th level**: Gain 2 levels.
* **8th–10th level**: Gain 1 level.
* **11th level**+: No effect.

**Effects**: All abilities of the additional levels are gained, including extra hit points.

**Damage**: Damage suffered while under the effects of this potion is first deducted from the pool of additional hit points granted.

# Potion of Invisibility
Drinking this potion, the character becomes invisible. This works the same as the magic-user spell invisibility (see p82). The standard potion duration applies.
* **Small doses**: At the referee’s discretion, a potion of invisibility may be consumed in six smaller doses, each with a reduced duration.

# Potion of Invulnerability
The character is magically protected from harm, gaining the following benefits:
* **Armour Class**: A +2 AC bonus.
* **Saving throws**: A +2 bonus to all saves.
* **Usage frequency**: If a character consumes more than one potion of invulnerability in the space of a week, the effects are inverted (a –2 penalty to AC and saves).

* **Vertical**: The character mentally directs vertical movement at up to 60’ per round.
* **Horizontal**: The character can push against solid objects to move laterally.

Appears the same as any other potion.
* **Effect**: Causes death (save vs poison).
* **Sipping**: Even a sip has the full effect.

# Potion of Polymorph Self
Upon drinking this potion, the character transforms into another being (of their choice). This works in the same way as the magic-user spell polymorph self (see p87). The standard potion duration applies.

# Potion of Speed
The character’s movements and actions are magically accelerated.
* **Movement**: Movement rate is doubled.
* **Attacks**: The number of attacks per round the character can make is doubled.
