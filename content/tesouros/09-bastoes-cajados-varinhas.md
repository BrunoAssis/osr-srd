B: Basic characters (levels 1–3)
X: Expert characters (level 4+)


# Charges
Rods, staves, and wands have a limited number of uses, called “charges”.

**Number of charges**: The number of charges in an item when discovered is determined by the referee, and depends on the type of the item. It is not possible for characters to discover the number of charges in an item.

**Usage**: Each use of the item takes one round and consumes one charge.

**Consuming the last charge**: The item loses its magical potency.

**Recharging**: Is not possible.

# Rods
**Usage**: All characters (unless noted).

**Dimensions**: Thin, 3’ long.

**Charges**: Unless noted, magic rods contain 1d10 charges when found.

# Staves
**Usage**: Spell casters. Some staves may only be used by either arcane or divine spell casters (this is noted in the item’s description).

**Dimensions**: 2” thick, 6’ long.

**Charges**: Unless noted, magic staves contain 3d10 charges when found.

# Wands
**Usage**: Arcane spell casters.

**Dimensions**: Thin, 1.’ long.

**Charges**: Unless noted, magic wands contain 2d10 charges when found.

# Rod of Cancellation
Drains the enchantment from a magic item that is touched.
* **In combat**: Usage requires an attack roll against AC 9 [10] (adjusted by the referee, if the target item is being actively used).
* **Effect**: The item that is touched becomes utterly non-magical.
* **One use only**: The rod may only be used once: it has but a single charge.

# Staff of Commanding
Grants the power to control animals, humans, and plants.

## Commanding Animals
* **Affects**: 1d6 normal animals or 1 giant animal (but not magical or intelligent animals).
* **Resisting**: No saving throw is allowed.
* **Visual range**: The character can only control animals that they can see.
* **Concentration**: Control is broken if the user of the staff moves or attacks.
* **When concentration ends**: The referee should make a reaction roll with a –1 penalty (see Encounters, p114) to determine the animals’ behaviour.
* **Usage frequency**: This power of the staff may be used up to once per turn.

## Commanding Humans
* **Usage**: A charm may be placed upon a human within 60’. One target may be charmed per round.
* **Resisting**: The subject may save versus spells (with a –2 penalty) to resist.
* **Maximum subjects**: Up to 6 Hit Dice of humans may be charmed in this way. Normal humans count as . HD.
* **Charmed individuals**: Regard the character as a trusted friend, and will come to their defence. They will obey the character’s commands, as long as these are not obviously harmful and do not contradict the subject’s alignment.
* **Duration**: The charm lasts indefinitely, but ends if cancelled by the wielder of the staff, or when dispelled.

## Commanding Plants
* **Affects**: All plants (including plant monsters) in a 10’ square area.
* **Range**: The area may be up to 60’ distant.
* **Commands**: Affected plants may be commanded to move around as the character wishes.
* **Concentration**: The effect lasts as long as the wielder of the staff concentrates.

# Staff of Healing
Has the power to heal those touched.
* **Divine magic**: Usable by divine spell casters only.
* **Effect**: Heals 1d6+1 hit points with each usage.
* **Usage limit**: Is effective on any individual at most once per day.
* **No charges**: Does not use charges; may be used an unlimited number of times.

# Staff of Power
An item of great wizardly power, this staff may be used as a weapon in melee, and may evoke five different magical effects.
* **Arcane magic**: Usable by arcane spell casters only.
* **Melee**: Expending one charge, inflicts 2d6 damage on a successful hit.
* **Cone of cold**: Conjures a cone of freezing energy, 60’ long and 30’ wide at the far end. Creatures caught in the cone suffer 8d6 damage (save versus spells for half damage).
* **Spells**: Can cast: continual light (see p81), fire ball (8d6 damage—see p84), lightning bolt (8d6 damage—see p85), telekinesis (up to 2,400 coins of weight—see p92).

# Staff of Snakes
A magical staff that has the power to transform into a snake, on command.
* **Divine magic**: Usable by divine spell casters only.
* **In melee**: Treated as a staff with a +1 magic bonus to attacks and damage.
* **On a successful hit**: Upon a human-sized (or smaller) creature, the wielder of the staff may speak the command word, causing it to transform into a serpent and coil around the victim.
* **Victims**: Must save versus spells or be immobilised in the coils of the snake. Victims are completely helpless while held by the snake (1d4 turns, or released as the wielder of the staff commands).
* **Snake**: Has AC 5 [14], HD 3 (20hp), and a movement rate of 60’ (20’).
* **When the victim is released**: The snake returns to the owner and transforms back into a staff. (At this point, it is healed of any damage it has suffered.)
* **If the snake is killed**: It does not return to its staff form, becoming non-magical.
* **No charges**: Does not use charges; may be used any number of times.

# Staff of Striking
Used as a magical melee weapon.
* **Expending one charge**: Inflicts 2d6 damage on a successful hit.
* **Usage frequency**: Only one charge may be spent per strike.

# Staff of Withering
Creatures hit by the staff are magically aged:
* **Divine magic**: Usable by divine spell casters only.
* **Effect**: The target is aged 10 years. Living creatures die upon reaching their natural life span.
* **Especially long-lived species**: Ignore the effects of a certain amount of ageing. (For example, elves may ignore up to 200 years of ageing, dwarves ignore up to 50 years, and so on.)
* **Undead creatures**: Are unaffected by the power of this staff.

# Staves in Melee
Although magic-users are generally only allowed to use daggers in combat, they are able to use the staff of power, staff of striking, and staff of wizardry in melee.

# Staff of Wizardry
An item of supreme wizardly power, this staff may be used as a weapon in melee, and may evoke a dozen different magical effects.
* **Arcane magic**: Usable by arcane spell casters only.
* **In melee**: Treated as a staff with a +1 magic bonus to attack and damage rolls.
* **Striking**: Expending one charge, inflicts 2d6 damage on a successful hit.
* **Cone of cold**: Conjures a cone of freezing energy, 60’ long and 30’ wide at the far end. Creatures caught in the cone suffer 8d6 damage, with a successful save versus spells indicating half damage.
* **Paralysation**: Conjures a cone of magical energy, 60’ long and 30’ wide at the far end. Creatures caught in the cone are paralysed for 6 turns (save versus spells to avoid).
* **Spells**: Can cast: conjure elemental (8 HD—p90), continual light (see p81), fire ball (8d6 damage—see p84), invisibility (see p82), lightning bolt (8d6 damage—see p85), pass-wall (see p92), telekinesis (up to 2,400 coins of weight—see p92), web (see p83).
* **Whirlwind**: Conjures a whirlwind 70’ tall, 20’ wide at the top, and 10’ wide at the base. The whirlwind lasts for 3 rounds, and moves at 120’ (40’), as the wielder of the staff directs. All in its path suffer 2d6 damage. Creatures with less than 2HD are swept aside (save versus death to avoid).
* **Sacrifice**: The wielder may sacrifice the staff by breaking it in two. Doing so unleashes a 30’ radius fireball that inflicts 8 points of damage per remaining charge in the staff. The wielder of the staff also suffers this damage.

# Wand of Cold
Conjures a cone of freezing energy.
* **Area**: The cone is 60’ long and 30’ wide at the far end.
* **Creatures caught in the cone**: Suffer 6d6 damage, with a successful save versus wands indicating half damage.

# Wand of Enemy Detection
Grants the power to detect nearby enemies.
* **Expending a charge**: Causes enemies within 60’ to be haloed in a fiery glow.
* **Hidden enemies**: Even enemies that are concealed or invisible are affected.

# Wand of Fear
Conjures a cone of magical energy that terrifies those within it.
* **Area**: The cone is 60’ long and 30’ wide at the far end.
* **Creatures in the cone**: Are struck with terror, and will flee from the wielder of the wand at maximum speed for 30 rounds. (A save versus wands negates the effect).

# Wand of Fire Balls
Conjures fire balls:
* **Range**: A streak of flame shoots towards an area up to 240’ distant.
* **Area**: The flame detonates in a 40’ diameter sphere of fire.
* **Creatures caught in the fire ball**: Suffer 6d6 damage, with a successful save versus wands indicating half damage.

# Wand of Illusion
Expending a charge, an illusion of the character’s choosing manifests. This works in the same way as the magic-user spell phantasmal force (see p83), except:
* **Concentration**: Is required to maintain the illusion. The wielder of the wand may move at up to half normal movement rate while concentrating. Concentration is broken if the wielder attacks, casts a spell, or is successfully attacked (damaged, targeted by a malicious spell, etc.).

# Wand of Lightning Bolts
Conjures strokes of powerful electricity:
* **Point of origin**: A lightning bolt may emanate from a point up to 180’ distant.
* **Area**: The bolt is 60’ long and 5’ wide.
* **Creatures caught in the lightning bolt**: Suffer 6d6 damage, with a successful save versus wands indicating half damage.
* **Bouncing**: If the lightning bolt hits a solid barrier before its full length is reached, it is reflected and travels for any remaining distance of its full length in the direction of the wielder of the wand.

# Wand of Magic Detection
Grants the power to detect magic nearby.
* **Expending a charge**: Causes magic items within 20’ to be haloed with light.
* **Concealed items**: Also glow, but the light might not be seen.

# Wand of Metal Detection
Grants the power to detect masses of metal of any type.
* **Expending a charge**: Causes the wand to point towards metal within 20’.
* **Type**: The type of metal is revealed.
* **Minimum mass**: Only masses of metal of at least 1,000 coins in weight are detected.

# Wand of Negation
Has the power to negate the effects of other wands or staves.
* **Declare intent**: Before rolling initiative, the wielder of the wand must declare the intention to use it.
* **Target**: Another wand or staff must be targeted.
* **Effect**: The effects of the targeted item are negated for one round.

# Wand of Paralysation
Conjures a cone of paralysing energy.
* **Area**: The cone is 60’ long and 30’ wide at the far end.
* **Creatures caught in the cone**: Are paralysed for 6 turns, with a successful save versus wands negating the effect.

# Wand of Polymorph
By expending a charge, the wielder of the wand or another creature within 60’ changes into another type of creature, as selected by the wielder. This works in the same way as the magic-user spells polymorph self and polymorph others (see p87).
* **Resisting**: An unwilling subject may make a saving throw versus wands to negate the effect.

# Wand of Secret Door Detection
Reveals the location of any secret door within 20’.

# Wand of Trap Detection
Reveals the location of all traps within 20’.
