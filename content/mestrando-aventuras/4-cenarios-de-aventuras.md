The first step in designing an adventure of any kind is to decide on the type of scenario. This is the hook that draws the player characters to the adventure site, and provides a background theme that the referee can use to tie the location together. The scenario drives the referee’s choices of specific traps, treasures, and monsters to be placed in the location. The following examples may be used for inspiration. 

# 1. Banishing Ancient Evil

An evil presence (e.g. a monster or NPC) must be banished or destroyed. It may have been dormant for many years, and have only recently been awakened (perhaps as a result of another party’s meddling).

# 2. Clearing Ruins

Settlers plan to move into an abandoned settlement or stronghold. Before they arrive, the PCs need to scout the area and clear out any monsters or other dangers that are present. The ruins need not be in a remote area—they could even be within (or beneath) a major settlement.

# 3. Contacting a Lost Civilisation

The PCs discover a long-lost race in a fantastic location. They may have once been human, but are now adapted to their strange environment. For example, they may have reverted to bestial behaviour or may be adapted to subterranean life, with pale skin and infravision.

# 4. Escaping from Captivity

The PCs have been taken prisoner by an enemy and begin the adventure in captivity, possibly with a grisly fate awaiting them in the near future. They must regain their freedom.

# 5. Exploring Unknown Territory

An NPC hires the party to explore and map an unknown region. This may be a previously uncharted area or may be a recent alteration to a familiar region (e.g. a magic castle may appear in an empty plain).

# 6. Performing a Quest

A deity or powerful NPC (e.g. a king) sends the PCs on a quest. This may involve recovering holy or magical items.

# 7. Rescuing Captives

Important NPCs have been kidnapped by bandits, wicked monsters, or an evil wizard. The PCs attempt to rescue the prisoners, either seeking a reward or because of a personal connection with the unfortunate captives. It is also possible that the PCs may be hired as bodyguards to NPCs who are negotiating with the kidnappers.

# 8. Scouting an Enemy Outpost

An invasion is looming (or in progress)! The PCs are tasked with infiltrating an outpost of the enemy, gathering intelligence as to their plans, strengths, and weaknesses, and (if possible) destroying them.

# 9. Seeking a Magical Doorway

A gateway exists that allows magical travel (either one-way or bidirectional) between distant locations or even other worlds. The PCs may be tasked with locating a lost portal or closing a portal used by enemies. The portal may also be the only means of travel to a fantastic destination that the PCs must visit.

# 10. Visiting a Sacred Site

In order to consult with an oracle, remove a curse, or find a holy relic, the PCs must journey to a sacred site (e.g. a shrine or temple). The exact location of the site is usually a matter of conjecture.
